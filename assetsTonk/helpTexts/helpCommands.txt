`!addme <class><subclass>` - Adds yourself to the mpa. The class area represents what class you want to register as. (i.e doing !addme fote will register you as a Force/Techer) You do not need to specify a class if you do not want to. Alternatively, you do not need to specify a subclass either. Something like `!addme fo` will work as well.
`!removeme` - Removes yourself from the MPA.
`!reserveme` - Adds yourself to the MPA's reserve list. If the MPA becomes full and someone either removes themselves or got removed by a manager you will automatically be placed in.
`!changeclass <class>` - Changes your class to the class specified. You may also use `none` to remove your class.
