----------------------

As an Ishana exclusive, `!startmpa` can also post an EQ banner if you choose to do so. Note that you will not be able to use a custom message if you use a banner.

To use it, type `!startmpa <eq>`. Replace `<eq>` with an EQ that is registered with the bot.

**Available EQs to be used:**
```css
deus
pd
magatsu
td3
td4
tdvr
mother
pi
trigger
yamato
seasonal
pvp
busterquest
dragon
cm
oloser (omegaloser works too)
goc
8man (hachiman works too)
12man
```

*note that the banners may only be used on the ishana server.*
