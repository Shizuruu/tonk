**Example Usage:** `!startmpa "I don't wanna be a lawyer" 8man` 
This will start an 8 player MPA with the message "I don't wanna be a lawyer"

Note that you need to format your message with a quote in it. Otherwise, the bot will ignore anything past the first word and just fire the MPA away with the first word you said.

:small_red_triangle: **MPA Auto expiration**
Tired of removing MPAs after your MPA concludes? No need to worry anymore! With this **toggleable** feature, MPAs that don't get any action after a set amount of time (90 minutes currently) will have the MPA automatically closed. Doing anything (adding/removing/reserving/etc.) will reset the timer.

Again, this is a toggleable feature, and is turned off for your channel by default.

:small_red_triangle_down: **The ability to schedule an MPA**
Want to start an MPA but not sure you or someone else will make it in time to start that list? No worries! You can now schedule an MPA with a new command and the MPA will be created at the time you set. More on that soon.


This is most of the new features being worked on, but not exactly all of them. I recommend running the `!help` command when the new update comes out to see everything that it incorporated in the new release.

Oh yeah, if you have or currently run into questions and don't know who to ask, I finally got a server running where you can contact me directly for help. You can find me at https://discord.gg/7QttYRd
I also post updates, announcements and any other useful/useless information about the bot in that server.

Personally, this is an exciting update for me as it finally removes a lot of the old garbage that was in the bot's code from when I first started working on this bot. I hope you find the changes to be exciting to use as well.

Until then.
