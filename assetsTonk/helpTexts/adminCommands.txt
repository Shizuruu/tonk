`!enablempachannel` - Registers the channel as an MPA channel and enables MPAs to be started in the channel.
`!disablempachannel` - Disables the ability to start MPAs in this channel (DOES NOT DELETE THE CHANNEL)
`!enablempaexpiration` - Enables the function to automatically close the MPA after a certain period of inactivity. Currently, the wait time before an MPA auto-closes itself is 90 minutes.
`!disablempaexpiration` - Disables the expiration function for a channel.
`!setmpablock <number>/clear` - Sets the MPA block for display on the list. Typing `!setmpablock clear` will remove the Meeting at field from the list.

Note that disabling the mpa channel will also remove the mpa expiration function for the channel as well. Meaning that if you disable the channel, and then re-enable the channel you will have to also re-enable the auto expiration function too.
