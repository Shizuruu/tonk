# Tonk

This is Tonk. A Discord bot meant to assist Alliance (NA)/Team (JP) officers and leaders in managing MPAs.

See the Wiki for more details on configuring the Bot for your server/channel.

You can invite the bot to your server here: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=296135515537932288&scope=bot&permissions=519232


## Self running
It is possible to run Tonk by yourself. Please keep in mind that you will need to provide your own AWS resources, which can incur extra charges. 

Procedures and templates will be coming soon
